# Team Preferences
As far as communication goes, our main communication will be through Slack. We agreed to keep all notifications on for our Slack group. We may not always be able to respond, but that way everybody can stay informed on how the group is doing throughout their day. Everybody is okay with receiving text messages as well, if they need an urgent response. As far as communicating with Nik, the online student in our team, we will have him on a Teams call during our in-person meetings whenever possible.

We would like to meet three times a week. Ideally, two of these meetings will be sometime during the week, and one time will be over the weekend. We currently plan on meeting at 5pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays, then after 3pm on Fridays. Since everybodys’ schedules vary quite a bit, we’ll check in with each other on every Sunday to see if anyone’s weekly schedule has changed. The location for our meeting will be a reserved room in the library. This is subject to change.
  
  
Throughout the semester, this team will aim to be very flexible and understanding of each others’ schedules while still holding one another accountable. This will require good communication. Regarding grades, we will try to get A’s on every assignment, though we understand that this may occasionally not be possible. If somebody is in a place where they don’t feel that they can put in the effort necessary for an A, we should have a group meeting. Here, we can discuss why someone might be okay with settling for a lower grade, and come up with a solution that everybody agrees on.


In regards to assigning different tasks throughout the team, we have concluded that an individual may choose a specific task/s in which they feel confident and have the strengths required to do the task. This will overall allow everyone to work efficiently and meet deadlines. There may be times where either everyone or a single individual doesn't have the knowledge to complete a task, and that is ok! We have come to an agreement that all members are willing to help in order to complete what must be done. Nothing will be done alone. Everyone is new to the tools that will be used for this project, which will be a great learning experience.
